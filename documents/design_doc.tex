\section*{Concept}
The player, Patient \#0x5F3759DF, has woken up in an unknown white-light treatment facility. An anonymous operator guides them through multiple levels testing their ability to solve logical puzzles and overall dexterity, through platforming, physics puzzles and using bullets to shoot targets within time, and ricochet bullets.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 3D First-person perspective 
	\item Platforming-inspired game
	\item Features
\end{itemize}

\section*{Goals and Objectives}
The player must work their way through:

\begin{itemize}
	\item jumping/platforming puzzles
	\item aiming challenges 
	\item physics puzzles
\end{itemize}

\section*{Controls / Interaction}
The player will be able to interact with the world through:
\begin{itemize}
	\item WASD + Spacebar controls 
	\item Captured mouse movement
	\item Mouse-button presses \\
\end{itemize}

This will enable them to move and jump onto platforms, move the camera to do so and be able to shoot at targets or ricochet projectiles.

\section{Core Mechanics}

The core mechanic of this game is using physics and movement (as the title says in Latin, dexterity) to unlock or reach the next area. This can be jumping across moving platforms without falling off, picking up and moving boxes to climb onto a ledge or press a pressure plate down, and using a weapon with ricocheting projectiles to activate a series of triggers. \\

These mechanics are initially taught to the user in the opening sequence before moving onto more difficult/engaging puzzles.
